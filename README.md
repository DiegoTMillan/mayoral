# technical test :computer:
This is the technical test from Mayoral.

## Presentation :green_book:
Hi! my name is Diego Tapia and here is the technical test. 
Although I have read an email from code space saying that it was not neccessary to do this project with next.js and typescript because we had not seen this tools in bootcamp. I decided to try to do it.
However, I had some issues with css.modules and typescript. In fact, I have used type only in the Card component. It is a challenge and I will carry on looking for an answer.


## Get Start :arrow_forward:

The structure of this project is a directory called "mayoral" that have inside two directories too. back and front.

Please, follow this steps:

  1. ### Requirements

Please check that apache and NPM is fully installed and operating

  2. ### Install

We are going to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DiegoTMillan/mayoral.git
```

Once, the project has been created. We have to install some dependencies:

1. ### Backend

```
 npm install express mongoose dotenv --save
```
```
 npm install cors
```

Please, remember that there is a JSON file with the database in back directory.

And finally

```
npm install
```

2. ### Frontend

I have created this project with Next.js and Typescript. Then I have installed some extra tools.

   1. ### Fontawesome icons

```
npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
```
```
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```
```
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
```
```
npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

   2. ### Fetch data from back

```
npm install axios
```

   3. ### Last step

```
npm install
```

## Breakpoints:

First, I have set CSS for a mobile device with 390px. After that I set a breakpoint for 1400 px or more. Just for the technical requirements: mobile and screen display.

## Objetives:

- Although font, icons and colors are not exactly the same, the structure is very similar.
- There are two breakpoints. Mobile and screen device.
- There is a JSON file inside back directory that has been used in compass for creating the database.
- The filter by name functions correctly.
- Sort by price clicking in icons function correctly, even though I could not create a separate component. I still working with that.
- I have not done any test. We only see only one hour about jest in the bootcamp. I tried to expand my knowledge about this field but the deadline is tomorrow and I decided to finish correctly other issues.
